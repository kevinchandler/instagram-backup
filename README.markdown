instagram-backup
================

Download a local copy of all of your instagram photos including their metadata
(such as description, likes, comments, etc).

## Instructions

0.  *Setup python requirements.*

    ```
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1.  *Create an application.*

    You need to create a new client application within Instagram using your
    account. Go to [Manage Clients][mc] within the developer dashboard and
    click *Register a New Client*.

    Enter anything you like for the name, description and website URL.
    The *Redirect URL* should be `http://localhost:4726/`.

    Once created, the information of your application will contain two
    strings, labelled *Client ID* and *Client Secret*. Copy and paste
    them into your terminal, like so:

    ```
    export INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID=<your client id>
    export INSTAGRAM_SECRET=<your client secret>
    ```

2.  *Get a client authentication token.*

    You then need to get an authentication token, which allows the backup
    script to behave *as you* on Instagram. Run the following command in
    your terminal

    ```
    python get_token.py
    ```

    then open your browser to <http://localhost:4726/>. Click the link
    to get your token â€” this will take you to Instagram to authorise,
    then present you with two more values to export to your Terminal.

    Stop the previous command by pressing Control and C at the same time.
    Then copy and paste the values from the browser.


3.  *Backup your photos.*
